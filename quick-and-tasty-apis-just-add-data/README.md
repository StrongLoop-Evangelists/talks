(the catburger talk)

By taking a data driven approach, we can use LoopBack.io, the open source Node.js library built on top of Express, to build out a full RESTful API in mere moments. If it's so fast and easy, what else should we cook up? How about relational data, remote methods and access control lists? Tasty, indeed!
